	<h2>Why oppose Marxism-Leninism?</h2>

	<h2>Where should one start with Marx?</h2>
	<p>The easiest place to start would be the manuscripts derived from speeches he gave to workers and communists, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/">Wage Labour and Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/">Value, Price and Profit</a>. As opposed to Marxist-Leninists, Marx himself did not see the proletariat as inferior, so these texts provide an accessible explanation of foundational Marxist ideas without simplification. Engels also wrote a short text explaining dialectics and historical materialism, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm">Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</a>. After these texts you can move on to reading <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/">Capital, Volume 1</a>.
